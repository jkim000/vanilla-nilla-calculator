## Just a standard calculator

Calculators have way more edge cases than I thought, so if you find an instance
where something breaks down, please let me know!

The UI and button layout was derived from the Windows 11 default calculator.

## TODO

-   [ ] Add in commas and have evaluations work around them
-   [ ] Have better sigfig implementation
